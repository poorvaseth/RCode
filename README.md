# RCode
This repository is a compilation of R code I have created. Some comes from coursework and assignments for classes like
STA442, and some is work I created during my Summer 2020 work-study term as a Data Analyst for the Student Life Department.

The STA442 document is code from an assignment I submitted for STA442: Methods of Applied Statistics.
The code is built from scratch and it primarily focuses on how I built GLM models, and how I interpreted these models to write reports 
addressing various research hypotheses. I used data from the Affairs and Smoking datasets provided in the assignment.

The nsse_model document showcases how I prepare datasets for analyzing, by refactoring, renaming and combining variables. I built simple linear models to address what predictors are significant predictors of student faculty interactions. This data comes from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) that was distributed to UofT students in 2014 and in 2017.
 
The exploring_nsse document indicates how I begin to explore a dataset in the rudimentary stages of analyzing. This involves compiling basic descriptive statistics and frequency plots to get an idea of how students responded to each survey question. 

The CCWS powerpoint is a presentation my supervisor and I presented during my work study term. This primarily showcases data visualizations, some of which I did on R and inserted screenshots into the powerpoint, and some of which I did on Excel. I no longer have the code for these graphs but I am quite confident with using R and ggplot specifically to prepare data visualizations. This data comes from survey responses to the Canadian Campus Well-Being Survey (CCWS).
