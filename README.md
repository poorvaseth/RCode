# RCode
This repository is a compilation of R code I have created. Some comes from coursework and assignments for classes like
STA442, and some is work I created during my Summer 2020 work-study term as a Data Analyst for the Student Life Department.

The STA442 document is an indicator of how I built GLM models, and how I interpreted these models to write reports addressing various research hypotheses.
The nsse_model document showcases how I prepare datasets for analyzing, by refactoring, renaming and combining variables. I built simple linear models to address what predictors are significant predictors of student faculty interactions.
